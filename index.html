      		<p class="main">Hi! My name is Nikita Shaiva, and I'm a junior at Dartmouth, and I am a cognitive science major and computer science minor.
            I hail from a small suburban town in NJ called Bedminster. I am an avid tea-drinker, gamer, mystery-fiction reader, photographer, and list-maker. I love board games, especially strategy board games like Sid Meyer's Civilization and Settlers of Catan. I am also a big fan of video games, especially adventure and role-playing games. When I was younger, I was virtually obsessed with the Nancy Drew and Agatha Christie game series, although I also enjoy life simulation games as well. I played the violin for most of my young adult life, but have been learning to play the piano and guitar from various books and youtube tutorials. I have played tennis for many years, and I would have to say Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the cream of the crop. I love to ski, and I enjoy the fast-paced slopes of Vermont and New Hampshire, and the powdery bowls out west in Colorado and Utah. I love reading murder mysteries, nonfiction psychology, and comedy (Mindy Kaling and Tina Fey are my idols). My favorite movie is <em>Inception</em>, followed by <em>Interstellar</em>, then either <em>Memento</em> or the <em>Departed</em>. I'm basically Christoper Nolan's biggest fan. I enjoy listening to indie, alternative, and edm music. My family hails from New Delhi, India, so I have spent many summers visiting relatives there. I love travel, nature, and landscape photography.
